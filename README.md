# UART-Universal-Asynchronous-Receiver-Transmitter-
 • Designed and simulated a UART system to enable asynchronous serial communication using digital logic.
 
 • Implemented transmission and reception of serial data using START, STOP, and PARITY bits.
 
 • Developed the module to operate without a shared clock signal, synchronizing through START bit detection.
 
 • Demonstrated serial-to-parallel and parallel-to-serial data conversion and ensured correct data sampling.
